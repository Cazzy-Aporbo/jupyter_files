    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project develops an LLM model focused on helping women ask better questions to their healthcare providers.\n",
    "The model is designed to address key challenges in women's healthcare:\n",
    "- Reducing medical bias and misdiagnosis\n",
    "- Empowering patients with better questions\n",
    "- Addressing health disparities\n",
    "- Improving preventative care\n",
    "- Contributing to women's health research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Multi-source approach gathering data from clinical trials, medical literature, \n",
    "   patient experiences, medical guidelines, and terminology\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Specialized NLP techniques for medical text with focus on women's health terminology\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of patterns in women's health data\n",
    "4. **Knowledge Graph**: Semantic network connecting conditions, symptoms, treatments, and questions\n",
    "5. **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of all components and how they work together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "All data used in this model comes from real-world sources:\n",
    "- ClinicalTrials.gov API for women's health studies\n",
    "- PubMed API for medical literature\n",
    "- Medical guidelines from professional organizations\n",
    "- Patient experience narratives from medical forums\n",
    "- Medical terminology with plain language explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "This notebook is designed to prepare data for training an LLM model. The LLM connection\n",
    "will be implemented separately after this data preparation phase.\n",

    "This notebook integrates all components of the women's health LLM model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "   - Multiple real-world data sources including clinical trials, medical literature, patient experiences\n",
    "   - Focus on women's health conditions, symptoms, treatments, and questions\n",
    "   - Comprehensive coverage of women's health topics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**\n",
    "   - Text normalization and cleaning\n",
    "   - Medical entity extraction (conditions, symptoms, treatments, body parts)\n",
    "   - Sentiment analysis of patient narratives\n",
    "   - Bias detection in medical communications\n",
    "   - Complexity analysis of medical terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - Condition frequency analysis in clinical trials\n",
    "   - Dismissal rate analysis in patient experiences\n",
    "   - Cross-dataset analysis to identify research gaps\n",
    "   - Visualization of key patterns and insights\n",

    "   - Question generation capabilities for women's health conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights from Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research-Practice Gap**: Significant disparities exist between conditions most studied in clinical trials and those most frequently reported in patient experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dismissal Patterns**: Certain conditions show significantly higher dismissal rates in healthcare settings, highlighting areas where better questions are most needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Terminology Complexity**: Medical terminology related to women's health conditions varies widely in complexity, with more complex terminology often associated with conditions that have higher dismissal rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Question Patterns**: Effective questions from patient experiences follow specific patterns, with \"what\" and \"why\" questions being most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using This Model for LLM Training\n",
    "\n",
    "The data prepared in this notebook is ready for training an LLM model with the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data**: Use the preprocessed datasets and knowledge graph as training data\n",
    "2. **Model Architecture**: Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanisms\n",
    "3. **Training Objective**: Given a condition and symptoms, generate appropriate questions\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess question relevance, specificity, and potential to address dismissal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect this data preparation pipeline to an LLM model\n",
    "2. Implement fine-tuning on the prepared datasets\n",
    "3. Create an evaluation framework for generated questions\n",
    "4. Develop a user interface for accessing the model\n",
