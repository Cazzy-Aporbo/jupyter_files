    "# Women's Health Data Collection - Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first in a series focused on creating a dataset for training an LLM model to predict better questions for women's health consultations. This part focuses specifically on data collection from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up the necessary environment and dependencies\n",
    "- Collect data from ClinicalTrials.gov API for women's health studies\n",
    "- Collect data from PubMed for women's health research\n",
    "- Create a structured dataset of commonly dismissed women's health questions\n",
    "- Implement save points to preserve collected data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Women's health questions are often dismissed in healthcare settings, leading to delayed diagnoses and treatment. By collecting data on commonly dismissed questions and their better alternatives, we can train an LLM to help women formulate more effective questions that are less likely to be dismissed by healthcare providers."
